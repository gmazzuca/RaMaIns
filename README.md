# RaMaIns

This repository is used to numerically compute and plot the eigenvalues distribution for the focusing Ablowtz--Laddik lattice, the Schur flow and the family of INB lattices. 

This repository contains 4 different python program.

The two "data" files contains the programs that geenrates the eigenvalues for the 3 different models
The two "plot" files make the plots

The library NUMBA is not strictly required, but it speed up the code quite a bit.

This code was used in Discrete integrable systems and random Lax matrices (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15371)
